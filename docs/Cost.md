# Robot Components and Cost

## ECE 3400, Fall 2018

Robots must cost less than $100. (We do not count basic components such as resistors, capacitors, amplifiers, Arduino, FPGAs, etc. towards that amount.) Your team must keep a running tally of the cost breakdown and present this number on the website.

The cost breakdown is as follows:

* Line (grayscale) sensors: $3
* IR distance sensors: $7
* Parallax servos: $13
* Parallax wheels: $3
* OV7670 Camera: $14
* Perfboard (full length): $6.50
* Basic components (resistors, capacitors, LEDs, Arduino Uno, FPGA, etc.): $0
* 3D printed/laser cut pieces: $0
* Milled PCBs: $0
* Each team will have 1 by 2 foot of acrylic available. It is definitely worth cutting your designs in cardboard or paper first, to make sure they work. 
* Used/salvaged parts can be used: you must clear those with the staff and the partsâ€™ list price will also count towards the total available budget. 
* Custom orders: If you'd like to order and use components which are not in stock in the lab: 1) write an email to the instructor detailing why you want these components as soon as possible, 2) we will order them for you (do NOT order them yourselves), 3) the cost of the component+shipping will be subtracted from your $100 budget.
