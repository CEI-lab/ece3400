# Robot Components and Cost

## ECE 3400, Fall 2018

Robots must cost less than $100. (We do not count basic components such as resistors, capacitors, amplifiers, Arduino, FPGAs, etc. towards that amount.) Your team must keep a running tally of the cost breakdown and present this number on the website.

The cost breakdown is as follows:

* Line (grayscale) sensors: $3
* IR distance sensors: $7
* Parallax servos: $13
* Parallax wheels: $3
* OV7670 Camera: $14
* Perfboard (full length): $6.50
* Basic components (resistors, capacitors, LEDs, Arduino Uno, FPGA, etc.): $0
* 3D printed/laser cut pieces: $0
* Milled PCBs: $0
* Each team will have 1 by 2 foot of acrylic available. It is definitely worth cutting your designs in cardboard or paper first, to make sure they work. 
* Used/salvaged parts can be used: you must clear those with the staff and the partsâ€™ list price will also count towards the total available budget. 
* Custom orders: We can buy parts for you, but the cost of the parts plus shipping goes towards your $100 total available budget. Order as soon as possible - it can take up to two weeks for parts to arrive. If you spend your own money to purchase/add components, you will need to provide the receipt to the staff, and the cost will go towards the total available budget. If your team really wants to use ultrasonic sensors, you can, but be warned that it will be tricky to use them appropriately in a maze environment. ALWAYS get approval from the Professor before ordering anything!
