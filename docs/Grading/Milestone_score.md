# Grading of Milestones
## ECE 3400, Fall 2017

The grading of all milestones will be based on what is reported on the websites. Although the TAs will be available to answer any questions during the normal lab-hours, they will not provide specific guidance on how you should meet these deadlines. These will be up to the teams themselves to coordinate.

Please be advised that you can receive partial points for any of these goals if you explanation is unclear or your implementation is lacking.

_Milestone 1 will be graded as follows:_

* 2 points: A robot that successfully follows a line of black tape.
* 3 points: A robot that successfully traverses a grid of black tape in a figure eight.
* Up to 5 points will be given for implementation (related to the robustness of the solution and the speed of the robot)

_Milestone 2 will be graded as follows:_

* 2.5 points (total of 7.5) per different treasure that can be detected and classified (the frequencies will be 7kHz, 12kHz, and 17kHz).
* 2.5 points to autonomously detect walls

_Milestone 3 will be graded as follows:_

_In simulation:_
* 4 points: Working algorithm that facilitates maze exploration.
* 1 point: Indicator that shows the robot is done (explored everything explorable)

_In real life:_
* 4 points: Working algorithm that facilitates maze exploration.
* 1 point: Indicator that shows the robot is done (explored everything explorable)

You donâ€™t have to worry about treasures/microphone circuitry yet, for either the simulation or the real-life maze exploration. You do have to include walls. We do not expect everyone to have a perfectly running system in this milestone, the goal is for everyone to start the implementation and think about (and convey on the website) what next tasks/improvements need to be done to compete in the final competition. 


_Milestone 4 will be graded as follows:_

* 3 points: System that successfully displays the walls in a maze as the robot finds them
* 3 points: System that successfully displays treasures in a maze as the robot finds them
* 2 points: Robot that successfully signals 'done' on the screen when the maze has been mapped
* 2 points: Robot that successfully plays 'done' on the speaker when the maze has been mapped
